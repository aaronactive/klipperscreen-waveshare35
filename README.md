Config.txt for running Klipperscreen with a Waveshare 3.5 rPI LCD Display (A)

Had issues with running Fluiddpi and then setting up Klipperscreen with a 3.5inch RPi LCD (A) - The driver install (https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/3.5inch_RPi_LCD_(A)) breaks config.txt

The config here should be right to go once LCD35-show is installed (if you rotate, make sure yout copy the display_rotate= value from the waveshare config.txt)
NB: The rotate function of LCDshow also does some things to rotate the touch display - so get your screen and everything correct first.
