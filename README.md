Config.txt for running Klipperscreen with a Waveshare 3.5 rPI LCD Display (A)

Had issues with running Fluiddpi and then setting up Klipperscreen with a 3.5inch RPi LCD (A) - The driver install (https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/3.5inch_RPi_LCD_(A)) breaks config.txt

The config here should be right to go once LCD35-show is installed (and rotated) - Copy this config.txt over your existing /boot/config.txt and then restart.

This config has been rotated so the USB-C power cord on my Rpi4 exits from the top of the unit.
